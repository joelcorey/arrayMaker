# arrayMaker

arrayMaker is a project I started to better understand multi-dimensional arrays in Javascript. The end goal here is to have a web application that allows for real time editing of an array. For now it will remain as a sort of semi-functional experiment.

It makes use of jQuery and jQueryUI.

If you find it useful then feel free to use it!
